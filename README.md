# Plant Disease Recognition System

## Overview

Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! This application is designed to help you identify plant diseases quickly and accurately using machine learning. By uploading an image of your plant, our system analyzes it to detect any signs of disease and provides recommendations for further action. 

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Navigate to the Disease Recognition page and upload an image of the plant you suspect might be diseased.
2. **Analysis**: Our system processes the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
3. **Results**: View the analysis results and receive recommendations for further action.

## Why Choose Us?

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques for precise disease detection.
- **User-Friendly**: Features a simple and intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Provides results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

## Getting Started

To start using the Plant Disease Recognition System:

1. Click on the Disease Recognition page in the sidebar.
2. Upload an image of your plant.
3. Receive instant results and recommendations.

## About the Dataset

This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset). 

### Dataset Details:

- **Size**: Approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves.
- **Classes**: Categorized into 38 different classes.
- **Split**: The dataset is divided into an 80/20 ratio for training and validation sets while preserving the directory structure.
- **Additional**: A new directory containing 33 test images was created for prediction purposes.
